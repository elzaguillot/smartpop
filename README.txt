**SMARTPOP** - Simulating Mating Alliances as a Reproductive Tactic for Populations

SMARTPOP is a fast and flexible forward-in-time simulator for population genetics. Specially developed for speed, it is available in a serial and a parallel versions.
Developed for anthropological inference on human populations, SMARTPOP simulates individuals with sequences of sex-linked DNA (mitochondria, X and Y chromosomes) and autosomes. Studies of social dynamics are enabled using SMARTPOP flexible demographic model and social rules of mating.
SMARTPOP can also be used to study animals exhibiting complex socio-ecological behaviours.

SMARTPOP is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
